				<p id="elemento" class="iftheworld">I was distracted And in traffic I didn't feel it When the earthquake happened But it really got me thinkin' Were you out drinkin'? Were you in the living room Chillin' watchin' television? It's been a year now Think I've figured out how How to let you go and let communication die out I know, you know, we know You weren't down for forever and it's fine I know, you know, we know We weren't meant for each other and it's fine But if the world was ending You'd come over, right? You'd come over and you'd stay the night Would you love me for the hell of it? All our fears would be irrelevant If the world was ending You'd come over, right? The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight And there wouldn't be a reason why We would even have to say goodbye If the world was ending You'd come over, right? Right?</p>
				<p id="elemento1" class="iftheworldd">If the world was ending You'd come over, right? Right? I tried to imagine Your reaction It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened But it really got me thinkin' That night we went drinkin' Stumbled in the house And didn't make it past the kitchen Ah, it's been a year now Think I've figured out how How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out I know, you know, we know You weren't down for forever and it's fine I know, you know, we know We weren't meant for each other and it's fine But if the world was ending You'd come over, right? You'd come over and you'd stay the night Would you love me for the hell of it? All our fears would be irrelevant If the world was ending You'd come over, right? The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight No, there wouldn't be a reason why</p>

				<p class="scarface">Y así nomás, viejo Puro Chuy Montana ¡Cha-chaú! Porte de ScarFace, me voy para L.A Haciendo billetes por todo U.S.A Parezco Tony Montana por el brillo y las cubanas Prendo lumbre al gallo, tres días enfiestado Quiero unas nenas que estén bien buenas Para pasar un buen rato Tres botellas, yo pedí, y, pa' el privado, me fui Disculpa si no contesto, no puedo atenderte aquí Esa morra me está viendo, quiere y no creo que consejos La vo'a llevar a disfrutar al mejor lugar Y así suena la Marca Sin Cadena, viejo Y arriba el Street Mob Y ahora me ven, ando muy bien Morras al cien, tiran DM, pero yo ni les contestos Y eso es muy cierto, un pase y ando alerto Botellas para el centro, porque este mundo es muy incierto (Fuck it) Porte de ScarFace, me voy para L.A Haciendo billetes por todo U.S.A Parezco Tony Montana por el brillo y las cubanas Prendo lumbre al gallo, tres días enfiestado Quiero unas nenas que estén bien buenas Para pasar un buen rato</p>
				<p id="elemento3" class="inthestars">Sunday mornings were your favorite I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road You did your hair up like you were famous Even though it's only church where we were goin' Now, Sunday mornings, I just sleep in It's like I buried my faith with you I'm screamin' at a God, I don't know if I believe in 'Cause I don't know what else I can do I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone I don't wanna say goodbye, 'cause this one means forever Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers Oh, it hurts so hard For a million different reasons You took the best of my heart And left the rest in pieces Diggin' through your old birthday letters A crumpled 20 still in the box I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it Even if it's the last 20 that I've got, oh I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone</p>
				<p id="elemento4" class="inthestarss">I don't wanna say goodbye, 'cause this one means forever Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers Oh, it hurts so hard For a million different reasons You took the best of my heart And left the rest in pieces I'm still holdin' on Holdin' on, holdin' on I'm still holdin' on Holdin' on, holdin' on I'm still holdin' on Holdin' on I'm still holdin' on I'm still, ooh Still holdin' on I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers Oh, it hurts so hard For a million different reasons You took the best of my heart Left the rest in pieces</p>
